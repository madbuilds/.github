## Hi there 👋

# 📘 Code Review with Emoji — Quick Guide Legend
Emoji is a quick and intuitive way to show the main theme of a message.
As Emoji tells a lot, it's a good practice to use it during code review/comments.

|        |             `:code:`             | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| 😃👍💯 |    `:smiley:` `:+1:` `:100:`     | GREAT - This is great! I like this... <br /><br /> ...and I want the author to know it! A way to highlight positive parts of a code review.                                                    |
|   ❓    |           `:question:`           | QUESTION - I have a question. Can you clarify?                                                                                                                                                 |
|   📌   |           `:pushpin:`            | PIN: This is a concern that is _out of scope_ and should be staged appropriately for followup (to complete by another task).                                                                   |
|   🔧   |            `:wrench:`            | CHANGE - I think this needs to be changed/reworked/updated. I have a suggestion.                                                                                                               |
|   ⛏    |             `:pick:`             | NITPICK - This is a nitpick... <br /><br /> ...does not mandatory changes but worth to be mentioned (formatting/style to be prevented).                                                        |
|   ♻️   |           `:recycle:`            | REFACTOR - Suggestion for refactoring.                                                                                                                                                         |
|  🤔💭  | `:thinking:` `:thought_balloon:` | THINKING: Let me think out loud here for a minute. <br /><br /> I might express concern, suggest an alternative solution, or walk through the code in my own words to make sure I understand.  |
|   🌱   |           `:seedling:`           | SEED: Planting a seed for future. <br /><br /> An observation or suggestion that is not a change request but may have larger implications. Generally something to keep in mind for the future. |
|   💡   |          `:lightbulb:`           | IDEA: Your code made me think of this new idea. No actions needed, I want to share this idea with you                                                                                          |
|   📝   |             `:memo:`             | NOTE: This is an explanatory note, fun fact, or relevant commentary that does not require any action.                                                                                          |
